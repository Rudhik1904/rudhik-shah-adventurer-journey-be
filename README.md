# Adventurer Journey - Back End
Please complete the story below and create a program to solve the problem. Commit any work back to the remote no later than 48 hours before the next interview.

*Please use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like to complete the story.*

## Story Instructions
You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

Adventurer Path & Instructions - [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md)

Given the Path Instructions above, programmatically parse the instructions and determine what is the Euclidean (straight line) distance from your starting point to the destination in steps?

**Tech Notes:**
- Use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like.
- Provide any needed instructions to run program.
- Do not round to the nearest step.
- After program executes the answer should be returned.


**Instructions to Run**
- Clone the solution
- Navigate to the clone directory 
- If you have not install python. Install Python using pip install Python3
- run the program with python3 solution.py
- progam will prompt you to enter the path: <enter_the_path>
- If you don't want to enter path enter "QUIT" to stop the program

**Assumptions & Clarification**
- "You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel" : I interpreted this sentence as when we change direction we also change direction (ex when traveler is facing north and move 5 steps left(5L) then he will be facing West)
- If this interpretation was wrong and I should interprete as we don't change direction when we move (ex when traveler is facing north and move 5 steps left(5L) then he will be still facing north but just moved 5 in the left directions) then we would need to change the following functions:

    # walk <steps> forward
    def moveForward(self,steps):
        self.yPos += ySteps
        return
    
    # walk <steps> backwards
    def moveBackward(self,steps):
        self.yPos -= ySteps
        return
    
    # walk <steps> in right direction
    def moveRight(self,steps):        
        self.xPos += xSteps
        return
    
    # walk <steps> in left direction 
    def moveLeft(self,steps):
        self.xPos -= xSteps
        return
